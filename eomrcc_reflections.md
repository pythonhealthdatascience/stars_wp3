# Reflections: Exeter Oncology Model

The aim of WP3 is to:

* Provide real-world applications of the framework
* While applying the framework, track:
    * Barriers and enablers to applying it
    * Shortcomings of the framework
    * Contrasts between applying the framework retrospectively and prospectively
    * The approximate time, work and rework required to apply the framework
* Potentially amend the framework based on these reflections
* Conduct reproducibility tests on the new repositories, adopting the same testing methodology as in WP1, by a member of the team not involved in the case study, sharing the results as a separate report with a short RCR report similar to those used in ACM journals. The results of these tests will be mapped to the ACM and NICO badge systems. 

This markdown file aims to address the aims of:

* Tracking barriers and enablers to applying the framework
* Tracking shortcomings of the framework
* Tracking approximate time, work and rework required to apply the framework

This is based on the logbook kept whilst applying the framework, `eomrcc_logbook.md`.
