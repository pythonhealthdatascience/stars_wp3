# HUMS Logbook

These are notes from using the STARS framework to guide the sharing of Stata do-files with analysis for an article currently being submit to journals:

> **Comparative responsiveness of preference-based health-related quality of life, social care and wellbeing, condition-specific and generic measures in the context of multiple sclerosis**
> 
> Elizabeth Goodwin, Amy Heather, Colin Green, Nia Morrish, Jenny Freeman, Kate Boddy, Sarah Thomas, Jeremy Chataway, Rod Middleton, Annie Hawton

Liz extracted do-files from MS Register - presently just those from analysis (and not pre-processing)

Uncertainty around what to include when working with personal person-level data. Is including just analysis scripts sufficient? Or is it ideal to also include pre-processing? In which case, along with dummy data?

This is a different context to what STARS was designed for for several reasons:

* Not FOSS - this was analysis in Stata which requires payment to use
* Not discrete event simulation - this was descriptive analysis and regression

Applicability and other considerations when non-FOSS. Here, there are things we can't do, like have free-to-use remote instances of this.

Also, when non-DES. In this case, arguably not particularly relevant to have a web application.

Made a skeleton README with categories based on STARS (e.g. ORCID, citation). Also making notes about archiving, acknolwedgements (for funding and dataset).
